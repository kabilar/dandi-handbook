# Terms of Use v1.0.1

The DANDI data archive ("DANDI") is offered by the DANDI project as part of its
mission to make available the results of its work.

Use of DANDI, both the uploading and downloading of data, denotes agreement with
the following terms:

1. DANDI is an open dissemination research data repository for the preservation
   and making available of research, educational and informational content. Access
   to DANDIâ€™s content is open to all.

1. Content may be uploaded free of charge by the US BRAIN Initiative and other
   projects required to submit data to a public archive and those without ready
   access to an organized data center.

1. The uploader is exclusively responsible for the content that they upload to
   DANDI and shall indemnify and hold the DANDI team free and harmless in
   connection with their use of the service. The uploader shall ensure that their
   content is suitable for open dissemination, and that it complies with these
   terms and applicable laws, including, but not limited to, privacy, data
   protection and intellectual property rights [1]. In addition, where data that
   was originally sensitive personal data is being uploaded for open dissemination
   through DANDI, the uploader shall ensure that such data is either anonymized
   to an appropriate degree or fully consent cleared [2].

1. Access to DANDI, and all content, is provided on an "as-is" basis. Users of
   content ("Users") shall respect applicable license conditions. Download and
   use of content from DANDI does not transfer any intellectual property rights
   in the content to the User.

1. Users are exclusively responsible for their use of content, and shall indemnify
   and hold the DANDI team free and harmless in connection with their download
   and/or use. Hosting and making content available through DANDI does not
   represent any approval or endorsement of such content by the DANDI team.

1. The DANDI team reserves the right, without notice, at its sole discretion and
   without liability, (i) to alter, delete or block access to content that it
   deems to be inappropriate or insufficiently protected, and (ii) to restrict
   or remove User access where it considers that use of DANDI interferes with
   its operations or violates these Terms of Use or applicable laws.

1. Unless specified otherwise, DANDI metadata may be freely reused under the
   [CC0 waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

1. These Terms of Use are subject to change by the DANDI team at any time and
   without notice, other than through posting the updated Terms of Use on the
   DANDI website.

* Uploaders considering DANDI for the storage of unanonymized or encrypted/unencrypted
  sensitive personal data are advised to use bespoke platforms rather than open
  dissemination services like DANDI for sharing their data.

[1] [2] See further the user pages regarding uploading for information on anonymization
of datasets that contain sensitive personal information.

If you have any questions or comments with respect to DANDI, or if you are unsure
whether your intended use is in line with these Terms of Use, or if you seek
permission for a use that does not fall within these Terms of Use, please [contact
us](https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/issues/new/choose).
