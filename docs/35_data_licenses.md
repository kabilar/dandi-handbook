# Data Licenses

To create a Dandiset, you must select a license under which to share the data.
Because the DANDI Archive provides a platform for open data sharing, the
licenses come from [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), an
international nonprofit organization dedicated to establishing, growing, and
maintaining a shared commons in the spirit of open source.

These licenses enable the dataset's copyright holder to grant permissions to
others to share and use the data for a wide range of purposes. The licenses
available to users of the Archive are as follows:

- **Attribution ([CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))**.
This license grants permission to share the data to others and to adapt the data
by remixing, transforming, and building upon it, so long as appropriate credit
is given to the copyright holder and any changes to the original are clearly
indicated. The dataset may be used for any purpose (even commercial ones). Note
that this license retains the original copyright while granting permissive
access to the data to all others.

- **Public domain dedication
([CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).** This license
dedicates the dataset to the public domain, relinquishing copyright and
therefore allowing anyone to use the dataset for any purpose without
restriction.
