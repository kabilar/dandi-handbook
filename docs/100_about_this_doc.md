# About This Documentation

This documentation is a work in progress and we welcome all input: if something
is missing or unclear, let us know by [opening an issue on our helpdesk](https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/issues/new/choose).

## Serving the Docs Locally

This project uses the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) tool with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
and extra plugins to generate the website.

To test locally, you will need to install the Python dependencies. To do that, type the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dandi/handbook.git
cd handbook
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are working on your *fork*, simply replace `https://github.com/dandi/handbook.git`
with `git clone git@github.com/<username>/handbook.git` , where `<username>` is your
GitHub username.

Once done, you need to run MkDocs. Simply type:

```
mkdocs serve
```

Finally, open [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your
browser, and you should see the default home page of the documentation being displayed.
